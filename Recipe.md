Mix the Dough
Knead the Dough

Knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes until soft and elastic in either a stand mixer with a dough hook or by hand on a lightly floured surface.  

Move the dough into a lightly greased bowl and cover with oiled plastic wrap over the bowl, but not touching the dough. Leave in a warm, but not hot place to proof for about an hour or until doubled in size.

Roll and Cut the Donuts

Roll the dough on a sheet of lightly floured baking paper until approximately 1/2-inch deep.  Using a 3 1/2-inch plain cutter (or a doughnut cutter if you have one) and a 1 1/2-inch cutter for the center hole. Roll up the excess dough, roll, and cut again.

Lay the donuts onto a lightly floured baking sheet, cover with a damp tea towel, and leave to rise for 30 minutes.

Fry the Donuts

Heat the oil in a deep pan or a fat fryer to 325 F. Once the oil is at temperature, cook the donuts a few at a time for 2 to 3 minutes each side until they are lightly golden. Do not overcook.

Remove from the hot oil with a slotted spoon and lay onto a paper towel to absorb any excess oil.

Glaze the Donuts

Once the donuts are all cooked, either roll them in caster sugar or glaze as you wish. 

Optional Glazes
For a simple glaze, mix 1 cup of confectioner's sugar with 3 tablespoons heavy cream and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. 

For a chocolate glaze, combine 2/3 cups of confectioner's sugar with 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder and 3 tablespoons heavy cream. 

The donuts are best eaten warm, but will keep for a few hoursâ€”though it's doubtful you will wait that long!
